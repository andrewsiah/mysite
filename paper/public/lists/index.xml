      <description>I exist on the shoulders of giants. Shoulders of kind, loving, selfless saints who spent time with me, invested in me, guided me. To you all, I am eternally grateful. Thank you for making a difference in this little boy‚Äôs life. Thank you for making this world, a better place to live in.
The list and detail below is by no means complete ‚Äì not even close. It is my small attempt in acknowledging the great people in my life.</description>
