      <description>The importance of setting goals Fail to plan, Plan to fail.
I first heard the above quote when I was in high school, sometime around when I was 13. It sounded like a truism, then again, one that I intuitively related with. We don&amp;rsquo;t achieve goals we didn&amp;rsquo;t set out for. Running on the premises that:
Life is filled with temptations and short-term candies Forgoing short-term temptations to put in effort takes conscious effort Any goals that are worth achieving requires effort and investment Then, planning or setting goals is the battleplan to success.</description>

      <description>Preface MEMSI is not a hackathon. MEMSI is not a business case competition. Heck, MEMSI does not even have monetary or opportunity prizes. No. The goal of MEMSI is to educate what entrepreneurship is like through simulation, immersing into one industry (for my year, it&amp;rsquo;s the aviation), and using the framework of Disciplined Entrepreneurship.
Teammates MEMSI filters their participants. There&amp;rsquo;s a simple interview and threshold one must pass (Year 3 and above).</description>

      <description>Impostor Syndrome I struggle with impostor syndrome. Through this blog, youtube, and meeting others, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt that it&amp;rsquo;s not in my place to contribute.
&amp;ldquo;Who am I to speak here? There are better people out there who are more qualified, more helpful, and more charismatic than me.&amp;rdquo;
The plot twist Recently, I stumbled upon an argument on why it&amp;rsquo;s our moral imperative to actually show our work. The premises are there</description>

      <description>The story As I stood on the side of the altar, observing my best friend stare down the aisle. Pianist starts playing Canon in D, and the bridesmaid leads the bride, gently and slowly, down the aisle. The bride and groom locks gaze, a pleasant smile hangs on their face. As the cousin of the bride and the bride reach the groom, the cousin hands the hand of the bride over to the groom.</description>

      <title>Fear Setting (A Model on Tim Ferriss&#39;s Framework)</title>

      <description>Introduction Our decision making process is often irrational. Because we often only have a method of rationalizing the costs and benefits, but no method for rationalizing fear.
For an example, assume you want to explore asking an opposite gender out. The benefit, if successful, is being able to go out with the girl and know her better. The cost, if unsuccessful, is shame and time wasted from the rejection. Shame is temporal, exists larger in your imagination.</description>

      <title>Why You Should Show Your Work</title>

      <description>Through my two years of studying at university, I have been graced with many opportunities. Friends who I scored Hackathons with; mentors who guided me on professional and private life matters; gracious recommendation letters that I received for my work; and interviews for jobs and scholarships that I’ve gotten from mutual friends.
What is the commonality above? That I have substance. Maybe not, I’m 100% sure there are many more out there who are more knowledgeable, with better GPA and a CV 10,000 lumen brighter than mine.</description>
