      <description>The story As I stood on the side of the altar, observing my best friend stare down the aisle. Pianist starts playing Canon in D, and the bridesmaid leads the bride, gently and slowly, down the aisle. The bride and groom locks gaze, a pleasant smile hangs on their face. As the cousin of the bride and the bride reach the groom, the cousin hands the hand of the bride over to the groom.</description>

      <description>Introduction Our decision making process is often irrational. Because we often only have a method of rationalizing the costs and benefits, but no method for rationalizing fear.
For an example, assume you want to explore asking an opposite gender out. The benefit, if successful, is being able to go out with the girl and know her better. The cost, if unsuccessful, is shame and time wasted from the rejection. Shame is temporal, exists larger in your imagination.</description>

      <description>Through my two years of studying at university, I have been graced with many opportunities. Friends who I scored Hackathons with; mentors who guided me on professional and private life matters; gracious recommendation letters that I received for my work; and interviews for jobs and scholarships that I’ve gotten from mutual friends.
What is the commonality above? That I have substance. Maybe not, I’m 100% sure there are many more out there who are more knowledgeable, with better GPA and a CV 10,000 lumen brighter than mine.</description>
