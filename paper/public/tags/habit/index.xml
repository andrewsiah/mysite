      <description>The importance of setting goals  Fail to plan, Plan to fail.
 I first heard the above quote when I was in high school, sometime around when I was 13. It sounded like a truism, then again, one that I intuitively related with. We don&amp;rsquo;t achieve goals we didn&amp;rsquo;t set out for. Running on the premises that:
 Life is filled with temptations and short-term candies Forgoing short-term temptations to put in effort takes conscious effort Any goals that are worth achieving requires effort and investment  Then, planning or setting goals is the battleplan to success.</description>

      <description>Preface It&amp;rsquo;s been 2 months since I last published here and on youtube. What happened in that timeframe? I met great friends in ipoh, went to Jing Wei&amp;rsquo;s marriage, started developing my work site, and played chess (Loads of chess). Am I happy? Is that enough?</description>
