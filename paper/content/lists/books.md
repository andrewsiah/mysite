- [**Deep Work**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyKI3GjyawvYXe8j8jOpRXZD24rBFQDsmXCavV-jiNo/edit) - _Cal Newport_
    - A manifesto that argues how long duration of focused work will be a rare and valuable commodity. Especially in an upcoming world where it's easier for everyone to be distracted (Social Media, Netflix, Youtube, etc).
- [**Atomic Habits**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/189cYa4QbN2Ne1KkrW74rRXLv5wGC1dmnCyRekDD4hRw/edit) - _James Clear_
    - Argues that greatness comes from consistent grinding. Also provides an S.O.P for instilling habits. 
- [**Getting Things Done**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NRD6u6o6KmdE0xkHDOV9JIJ0mAS2F_qmBnlOnAC8Zzw/edit) - _David Allen_
    - The O.G. gold standard for instilling a system for handling work and living a stress free life. Doesn't apply as much for makers though.
- [**Courage to be Disliked**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YecsrbbdL9UxALtl9RsuwILxbLv4raGoJpa67kFlS-Q/edit) - _Ichiro Kishimi_
    - Argues that we are in control of our emotions and that we are not our traumas. A manifesto on living a socially happier life.
- [**The Checklist Manifesto**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTcDXUbbGBygxRzEMtKKH1Sg9sH-YeooYbigwePXFl4/edit) - _Atul Gawande_
    - Making an argument for checklists. After the numerous times of forgetting something as pivotal as a shoe at a badminton game, and a tie for an interview. I live by checklists prior to this book. Still interesting to see how big a difference checklists makes in the healthcare industry.
    - I have a compiled list of checklists [here](/checklist)
- [**Essentialism**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbcR7OncX-pkLyLT-HI6Chg5LPDDgRndyns7BEqgYqY/edit) - _Greg Mckeown_
    - A more nuanced take on minimalism. Although rather close siblings. 
- [**Show Your Work**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljebnvGslyICIZN717XUYPcIKKXteq9fvQAgOer7trg/edit) - _Austin Kleon_
    - A read-in-an-afternoon book for people who needs convincing that showing your work is the 21st century of CVs. Although, the most important part is practicing doing the work after.
- [**How To Be Miserable**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YPDED-16EMj5ObnEbbr6CbRFnoMYEW1IZ4juzaBPQ6c/edit) - _Randy J.Paterson_
    - An anti approach to how to be happy. Similar to [How to be a loser](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=how+to+be+a+loser). This book contains the key essentials to *not* living a miserable life.
