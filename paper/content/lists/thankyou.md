I exist on the shoulders of giants. Shoulders of kind, loving, selfless saints who spent time with me, invested in me, guided me. To you all, I am eternally grateful. Thank you for making a difference in this little boy’s life. Thank you for making this world, a better place to live in.

The list and detail below is by no means complete – not even close. It is my small attempt in acknowledging the great people in my life. 

### Ms Goh Kai Lian
Thank you for believing in my potential in spite of the nuisance and immature self that I was to you. It has driven me through dark times when I’ve lost all confidence in myself.

### Koay Jing Wei
Thank you for loving and sharing your time with me. No one comes close to how instrumental you have been in shaping me.

### Sandeep Chulani
Thank you for spending time with me. Challenging and sharpening my thoughts and worldview through suppers and time together. You have been a great confidante and mentor. 

### Dr. Ivan Borzenets
Thank you for giving me a chance to work and learn from you. For answering my questions intently and for guiding me when I’m unsure of my life’s direction. 

### Nicholas Yeo Wei Ming
Thank you for giving me your time and being an honest brother at all walks of life and decision making processes. Alas, 知音难寻.
