### The story

As I stood on the side of the altar, observing my best friend stare down the aisle. Pianist starts playing [Canon in D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptk_1Dc2iPY), and the bridesmaid leads the bride, gently and slowly, down the aisle. The bride and groom locks gaze, a pleasant smile hangs on their face. As the cousin of the bride and the bride reach the groom, the cousin hands the hand of the bride over to the groom. They smile, happy. And turn their bodies down to facing the officiant. 



I, groom, take you, bride, to be my wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward; for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part; according to Godâ€™s holy law. In the presence of God I make this vow.
