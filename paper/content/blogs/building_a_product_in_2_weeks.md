## Objective
The purpose of this piece is to document our steps and the ultimate goal from ideation to acquiring 50 sign-ups in 2 weeks without any paid marketing efforts.

## The Journey

### Week 1

#### Ideation
We sifted through a list of startup ideas, landing on one that felt timely and within our capabilities: helping people find their "average 5." Interviews with friends helped refine the problem we aimed to solve.

#### Landing Page
We built and deployed a landing page using a template and firebase hosting, sharing it on productivity subreddits.

#### Analytics
Setting up Hotjar, Google Analytics, and Facebook Pixel was challenging, but it was crucial for tracking traffic quality.

### Week 2

#### The App
We chose speed and design over robustness, using Appgyver and Firestore for our MVP, which included:

1. Sign-up authentication.
2. User goal submission.
3. Automated email notifications upon sign-up and squad matches.

#### Deploy
We linked the app with the landing page's CTA, deployed it, and achieved 50 sign-ups through intensive marketing.

## Lessons

### Build Less
In retrospect, we could have omitted the app initially, focusing instead on improving the user journey and experience.

### Online Marketing is Vital
Robust analytics are essential for quality data and informed decision-making.

### Put a Paywall as Validation
Our high sign-up rate didn't translate to retention, suggesting the need for a paywall to better gauge true user interest.

## Summary
While there's no product-market fit yet, the 50 sign-ups indicate potential interest that warrants further development.
