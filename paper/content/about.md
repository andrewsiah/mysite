## Me in 2 min

I'm Andrew, a Malaysian Physics undergrad on a dual-degree programme between [Columbia in NY](https://www.columbia.edu/) and [CityU in HK](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). 

I've never been the smartest or the most talented in anything. I'm just curious and ask questions.

This is my favourite emoji :man_shrugging:. 

I'm currently on a gap year, till Sept 2021, documenting my autodidacy on Youtube and here. 

I'll love to make new friends, please reach out to me for anything! (hi@andrewsiah.com)
